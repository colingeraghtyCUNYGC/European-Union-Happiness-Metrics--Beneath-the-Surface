Wellcome Global Monitor 2020
Wellcome conducted the first Global Monitor – the largest-ever study of public attitudes to science and health – in 2018. The first wave covered topics such as whether people trust science, scientists and information about health, and attitudes towards the safety and efficacy of vaccines – a focus which has since proved incredibly forward-thinking.

In 2020, the Global Monitor's central focus was science's role in mental health.

The datasets and crosstabs cover the mental health sections of the WGM Survey 2020 conducted in 113 countries and territories worldwide on mental health views and experiences. The rest of the survey data will be published in subsequent data releases.
